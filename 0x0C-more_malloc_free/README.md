Write a function that allocates memory using malloc.

    Prototype: void *malloc_checked(unsigned int b);
    Returns a pointer to the allocated memory
1. string_nconcat
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

Write a function that concatenates two strings.

    Prototype: char *string_nconcat(char *s1, char *s2, unsigned int n);
    The returned pointer shall point to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains s1, followed by the first n bytes of s2, and null terminated
    If the function fails, it should return NULL
2. _calloc
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc.

    Prototype: void *_calloc(unsigned int nmemb, unsigned int size);
    The _calloc function allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
    The memory is set to zero
3. array_range
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

Write a function that creates an array of integers.

    Prototype: int *array_range(int min, int max);
    The array created should contain all the values from min (included) to max (included), ordered from min to max
    Return: the pointer to the newly created array
4. _realloc

Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

Write a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free

    Prototype: void *_realloc(void *ptr, unsigned int old_size, unsigned int new_size);
    where ptr is a pointer to the memory previously allocated with a call to malloc: malloc(old_size)
    old_size is the size, in bytes, of the allocated space for ptr
